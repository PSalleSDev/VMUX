# Introduction

VMUX - Simple termux "workspace".

This is a CLI to handle files and folders.

### Configurations

Settings are written in json due to the purposeful affinity this file type has with nodejs.

**Both files are mandatory. they do not necessarily need to be edited, but they need to exist for the software to work correctly**

- Commands: Here is the file responsible for saving the commands that will be available at the time of handling [init.json](init.json)
- Icons: The icon file applies an icon depending on its suffix. This is an example of a file [icons.json](icons.json)
